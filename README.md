### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Kiane Lucia Casagrande from Brazil (ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·). I've been working as Front-End Developer since 2016 and currently I'm Developer at [Icarus Tech](http://icarustech.com.br). I'm an extremely communicative person, love what I do and always try to help the people around me.

In my free time I like to run (and walk) (:running:), to ride a bike (:bicyclist:), to watch movies and series (ðŸ“º), to read books (ðŸ“š), to travel (:airplane:) and I love playing with my dogs (:dog:).

Would you like to find me?
